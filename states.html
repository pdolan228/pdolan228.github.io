 <h1>States Analysis</h1>   
    
    <p><a href=" https://alaska.gov" target= "_new">Alaska</a></p>
  <p>The website for Alaska I have mixed feelings about. There is an abundance of information that a user could use. I believe this is good and bad. An abundance of information can cause an overwelming feeling to the user, but also everything a person would need to know about the state of Alaska. The wedsite is also not phone friendly meaning that the site is not good to be looked at on a phone. The website does not format to the phones screen size causing you to have to scroll and move around a lot to see all the information provided.</p>
    
    
     <p><a href="https://az.gov" target= "_new">Arizona</a></p>
    <p>Arizonas website is excellent. This website is simple,creative, and easy to navigate.The website is also phone friendly. This could cause in a rise in site visits and could cause tourism to rise. Arizonas website is the perfect website for people who know very little to nothing about Arizona. This website was made with great care. This is evident because the colors and background images are well put together and flow perfectly.</p>
    
    
    
     <p><a href="http://mt.gov" target= "_new">Montana</a></p>
    <p>Montanas website was made with excellence. The information on the page is well organized and well put together. The website is phone friendly and the information is to the point with just the right amount of information. This site really shows what Montana is all about. The colors really fit well togethor and the background picture is clear and fits the page well. The font is perfecrt and really easy to see. This site is top noche. </p>
    
    
    
     <p><a href="http://www.nebraska.gov" target= "_new">Nebraska</a></p>
    <p>Nebraskas website is decent at best. the colors and font fit well together and the page is easy to navigate. The downfall of this website is that the background image is blurry and makes Nebraska look subpar. This site also repeats a lot of information. For example, if you click the circle tabs in the middle of the website it will bring you to the same place as the taps on the top of the page. All in all this page was subpar to me.</p>
    
    
     <p><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target= "_new">New Hampshire</a></p>
    <p>New Hampshires website is not very good. This site is not phone friendly and is very plain and bland.The colors do not fit well together and the background image is a little blurry. The font might be hard to read to some people becasue of the color of the font. There are some pros to this website. The information is very clear and to the point. The information is also well organized. This site is below average compared to some of the other websites.</p>

    <h1>Least Favorite Website</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target= "_new">New Hampshire</a></p>
    <p>This website is the worst of all the other sites. The background image was blurring and the colors do not go well together. The site is also not phone friendly which is a big problem in todays world. It seems as if this website was thrown together and not really well thought out.</p>
